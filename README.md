*Bike rental prediction* at its core represents an advanced application of predictive analytics and machine learning, employing a robust **Random Forest model** to forecast bicycle rental demand with unparalleled precision. This sophisticated model goes beyond traditional approaches by meticulously analyzing an array of factors, including seasonal patterns, weather conditions, and temporal trends, to provide nuanced insights into user behavior and rental dynamics.

By harnessing the power of the *Random Forest algorithm*, known for its ensemble of decision trees and enhanced accuracy, the predictive model enables rental service providers to make data-driven decisions. This includes optimizing inventory levels, tailoring pricing strategies, and streamlining operational processes. The *Random Forest model* excels at capturing complex relationships within the data, ensuring a more accurate prediction of bike rental counts.

This predictive tool serves as a strategic asset, not only anticipating demand fluctuations but also acting as a catalyst for informed decision-making. It empowers businesses to proactively adapt to changing market conditions, enhance resource allocation, and deliver an exceptional and responsive rental experience.

In summary, the *bike rental prediction model*, driven by the *Random Forest algorithm*, is a powerful and sophisticated solution that transforms data into actionable insights, fostering operational efficiency and elevating customer satisfaction in the dynamic landscape of bike rentals.

## Outcome and Analysis:

1. **Prediction of Linear Regression Model, Decision Tree and Random forest Model:

   
**Prediction done by Linear Regression Model:**
![Prediction using Root-Mean Square](https://github.com/Anamicca23/Bike-Rental-Prediction/assets/99593529/cd39026f-3489-4d39-b978-1b94800d7f26)

**Prediction done by Decision Tree Model:**
![prediction using decision tree forest](https://github.com/Anamicca23/Bike-Rental-Prediction/assets/99593529/ecbeabde-7d39-4bfc-bffe-78733c34182f)

**Prediction done by Random Forest Model:**
![Prediction using random Forest regressor](https://github.com/Anamicca23/Bike-Rental-Prediction/assets/99593529/bfae504c-32c0-4d0b-a7a2-9580ead1bb0f)


2. **Accuracy of all the three Model:**

   
![Accuracy table for diffrent model](https://github.com/Anamicca23/Bike-Rental-Prediction/assets/99593529/83df41a0-ebbf-4d07-9716-5ae757ff301d)


3. **Best Model out of all three for Bike-Rental Prediction:**

![Best Model out of all three](https://github.com/Anamicca23/Bike-Rental-Prediction/assets/99593529/3dcf0d26-78fa-48d5-94ef-2ddec3f26756)


4. **Result:**
  - Lower values of RMSE and MAE indicate better model performance. Here, the Random Forest Regressor model shows the best performance among the three models evaluated.
  - When comparing RMSE and MAE of all 3 models, the random forest model shows the least errors. Thus, the random forest model is considered the best for predicting daily bike rental counts.

    
Enjoy exploring and predicting bike rentals with the R program!
